# Non-parametric-test-advanced-

## summary of the non-parametric tests and their use cases:

### 1. Mann-Whitney U test: A test to compare two independent samples and determine if there is a significant difference between their distributions. It is used when the data is not normally distributed or when dealing with ordinal data.

### 2. Wilcoxon signed-rank test: A test to compare two related (paired) samples and determine if there is a significant difference between their distributions. It is suitable for non-normally distributed data or ordinal data.

### 3. Kruskal-Wallis test: A test to compare three or more independent samples and determine if there is a significant difference between their distributions. It is appropriate for non-normally distributed data or ordinal data.

### 4. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: A test to assess the strength and direction of the association between two continuous or ordinal variables, especially when the relationship is not necessarily linear.

### 5. Chi-squared test: A test to assess the independence or association between two categorical variables in a contingency table.

These tests are used in various situations when dealing with non-normally distributed data, ordinal data, or when testing the association between categorical variables.
